Bug #1
Looking at it initially, I knew that I had to somehow find a code that would retrieve information that
the drop zone was occupied. 

Reading the debugging strategies gave me a start, I was able to learn about the return function
which I was hinted to google which could essentially "exit" the function. After that it was a matter
of figuring out an if code that could sense the child inside the parent. 
I asked ChatGPT for a code that could detect children inside a parent and it gave back the 
childEl.length > 0 code.
Then I just slotted in the if and this statement as per the debugging strategies hint and added the
return function to break the function if it detected there was a piece already slotted in. Then it
was just a matter of using my last line on console logging it to show that it actually detected it.

Bug #2
Looking at the 2nd bug I can see that I have a problem as I'll need to essentially write a function
for two things, clearing the board upon selecting a new board and clearing the board upon clicking
the reset button.

I followed the tips given in the debugging strategies again, already had the if statement to check 
the puzzleBoard for any children inside of it from bug fix 1.
I then asked chatGPT to give me a forEach loop that could return the pieces to the dragZone container
if detected in the puzzleBoard. It gave back exactly what I needed and I just slotted in the necessary
parameters and the console log to confirm that it actually worked on click.

At this point I went thru hell to try and get the reset function to work. Eventually I landed on
placing the reset button into a div of its own and adding the ID of the resetBut into the buttons 
querySelector rather than making it its own selector. Then adding an event listener to monitor when 
its clicked. It worked so Im done
